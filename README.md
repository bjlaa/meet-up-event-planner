# Meet Up Event-Planner

In this project I built a React Application allowing the user to create an account and post his event(s). The App is fully Responsive and all its input forms are built in order to ease the UX (validation, labeling). 



==============================================
In order to display the Meet Up Event-Planner:
==============================================

* Download the zip file from Github. From the command line:
	- change directory to the folder downloaded
	- type in npm install to create the node_modules folder,
	- type gulp and press the Enter key 
This will launch a localserver on your machine and allow the App to be displayed.

or 

* Go to my [Github Page](http://bjlaa.github.io/meet-up-event-planner) for this project.
